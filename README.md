# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Project

## 📌 Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a real-world, full-stack web application designed to simulate a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It offers learners hands-on experience in backend architecture, API development, database design, and DevOps practices. This collaborative project emphasizes building secure, scalable, and maintainable systems.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **User Management:** Secure registration, authentication, and profile handling.
- **Property Management:** Create, update, and retrieve property listings.
- **Booking System:** Enable property bookings with full CRUD operations.
- **Payment Processing:** Handle transactions and track payment history.
- **Review System:** Allow users to post and manage property reviews.
- **Performance Optimization:** Use indexing and caching for improved data access.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API Technologies:** REST (OpenAPI), GraphQL
- **Task Queue:** Celery
- **Caching:** Redis
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **DevOps:** GitHub Actions, CI/CD Pipelines

## 👥 Project Team Roles

- **Software Architect:** Designs the system architecture, selects the tech stack, and ensures code quality through standards and reviews.
- **Software Developer:** Implements the application features. Frontend developers handle the user interface, while backend developers manage logic, algorithms, and data flow. Full-stack developers do both.
- **Database Administrator (DBA):** Designs, implements, and manages the database system. Ensures data integrity, optimizes query performance, handles backups, and manages indexing and schema updates.
- **QA Engineer:** Ensures the application meets all functional and non-functional requirements through various testing types and documentation.
- **Test Automation Engineer:** Builds test scripts and automation frameworks to streamline the testing process and provide rapid feedback on application stability.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Bridges development and operations, builds CI/CD pipelines, and ensures efficient, stable, and automated deployment workflows.

## 📚 Documentation

- REST APIs follow the **OpenAPI standard** for clear and consistent documentation.
- GraphQL API supports flexible and efficient data querying.
